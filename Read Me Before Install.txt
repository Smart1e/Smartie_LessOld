If you have not already, please ensure that you have python installed on your system.
I have saved an installer in the file already, but if you for some reason don't trust me, 
you can just search "python download" and follow the top link to get the latest version
for your operating system.

PLEASE NOTE:
This won't work on every operating system yet. 

CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEMS:
Windows 10 and below.
